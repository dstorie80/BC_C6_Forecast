# BC_C6_Forecast
A weather dashboard that shows the 3 hour forecast for the selected city and then a 5 day forecast. It also keeps a history of the entered cities so they can be looked at later.

## Description

This project was created as practice for handeling APIs.  This allows us to gather data and inject it into different parts of both the HTML and JS codes.

- The project was an aid to help us understand how to work with calling external APIs
- This project made me realize where my strengths are and where I need to spend a littl more time.  Calling APIs and manipulating the data was a bit more challenging than expected. 
- I ran out of time and was unable to create the 5 day forecast but the data is in the local store.  
- This project served as training excercise for the group project we are currently working on.  In our project we are calling multiple apis to handle different aspects of the data we are collecting.
